## Special Thanks
Thanks a lot [@Karlatemp](https://github.com/Karlatemp) for startup. She made me known to JDWP & JDI. If without her, I would spend a lot of time on messing with netty & JVM internals.

## Others
Macchiato is a program that was for the competition on [lev.zone]([lev.zone](https://www.lev.zone/)) (but due to Astro angelfish is too busy to continue developing, she had to give up the competition.). Started by Astro angelfish and developed by HashRun and OrangeMC.
It is still under heavy development and its functions or code might be changed massively.
